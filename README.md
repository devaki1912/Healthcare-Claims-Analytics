# Healthcare-Claims-Analytics
Power BI dashboard for healthcare claims analysis, tracking rejection rates, settlement timelines, and revenue leakage using real insurance datasets.
Healthcare Claims Analytics – Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview

Healthcare insurance companies process a high volume of claims involving multiple hospitals, policy types, and members. Tracking claim approvals, rejections, settlement timelines, and revenue leakage manually is inefficient and prone to errors.

This project uses Power BI to build an interactive analytics dashboard that provides clear visibility into claims performance, helping insurers identify operational issues, financial losses, and improvement opportunities.

**Problem Statement**

Insurance providers lack a centralized system to analyze healthcare claims data. As a result:

High claim rejection rates go unnoticed

Settlement delays impact customer satisfaction

Revenue leakage is difficult to track

Decision-making becomes slow and reactive

This project addresses these challenges by transforming raw claims data into meaningful insights.

 **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

The dashboard tracks the following KPIs:

Total Claims – Total number of insurance claims raised

Total Claim Amount – Total amount claimed by customers

Total Approved Amount – Total amount approved by the insurer

Rejected Claims – Number of claims rejected

Claim Rejection Percentage – Rejected claims as a percentage of total claims

Average Settlement Days – Average time taken to settle claims

Revenue Leakage – Difference between claimed and approved amounts

**Business Analysis Focus**

Identify hospitals with high claim rejection rates

Detect revenue leakage across hospitals and policy types

Analyze settlement delays and operational bottlenecks

Compare claim performance by hospital, city, and policy type

Enable management to take corrective, data-driven actions
